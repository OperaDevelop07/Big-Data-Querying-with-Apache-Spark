# Big-Data-Querying-with-Apache-Spark
In this project we experimented with apache spark queries on big datasets like the movielens dataset ("https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/") and tried to optimised their perfomance both on local cluster scenarios and at cloud/server scenarios like the livy server("https://livy.apache.org/").
